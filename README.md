tiny-test-data
==============
Super small biological datasets designed with unit testing in mind.

Rationale
=========
Tests are great to have but they are not very fun to write and coming
up with small datasets for testing, especially given the myriad of
file formats we deal with, is often super annoying.  One way to make
tests less not-fun to write is to have a handy set of tiny test data
at hand.
